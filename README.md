# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScript Project. I am excited to finally apply some of things I've been learning this past week about JS.

`` Psuedo code
`` Generate ComputerChoice for Round of Game randomly using variables:
``rock,paper, scissors | store value 
``Prompt user to choose variable from the same set | store value 
``Play Round 
	`` User wins round if
		``User chooses Rock & Computer chooses Scissors
		``User chooses Paper & Computer chooses Rock
		``User chooses Scissor & Computer chooses Paper
	``User loses round if 
		``User chooses Rock & Computer chooses Paper
		``User chooses Paper & Computer chooses Scissors
		``User chooses Scissor & Computer chooses Rock
	``User ties round if 
		``User choice = Computer choice
